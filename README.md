##Description
Visualize (HTML5) plasma concentration time curve based on dose and concentrations. Calculated PK parameters enable to personalize drug dose. 

#Quick start
Use the following link to get an idea how this tool works:

* http://modules.epha.ch/vigi/kinetics.html#bio=100&dosierung=2000&tau=12&hwz=10&v=42&c1=15&t1=11&otb=40&utb=15

C1 and T1 you can be taken from the Plasma-Concentration Reader. If you want to work more precisely you should fill in C2 and T2 as well.

If you have a second measurement you can update the values in "Populationsdaten". "Populationsdaten" are generally taken from the Swiss-Fachinfo. They are based on average measurments. So to be more precise you need a second measurement.

F in % stands for Bioverf√ºgbarkeit.
