#Pharmacokinetic

##Description
Visualize (HTML5) plasma concentration time curve based on dose and concentrations. Calculated PK parameters enable to personalize drug dose. 

##Quick start
Use the following <a target="_blank" href="http://modules.epha.ch/vigi/kinetics.html#bio=100&dosierung=2000&tau=12&hwz=10&v=42&c1=15&t1=11&otb=40&utb=15">link</a> to take a test drive.

##Use case
This tool was tested by a live sample between two hospitals where Doctor A asked Doctor B to calculate the half-life if the dosage changes. The Plasma Concentration measurement (16.8) almost matched the prediction (17.0) by the Pharmacokinetic tool.
C1 and T1 can be taken from the Plasma-Concentration (PC) Reader. It is recommended that you do a second PC-Reading (C2 and T2) to personalize the dosage for the patient.

If you have a second measurement you can update the values in "Populationsdaten". "Populationsdaten" are generally taken from the Swiss-Fachinfo. They are based on average measurments. So to be more precise you need a second measurement.

F in % stands for Bioverf√ºgbarkeit.
